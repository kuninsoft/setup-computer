To apply thermal paste onto the processor, put a small pea-sized drop of the thermal fluid onto the chip and carefully flatten it over the processor's surface.

Be especially careful, if thermal fluid gets onto the motherboard, it can damage it. If this happened, gently remove the thermal fluid from the surface with a paper towel.
